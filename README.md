## 🚨 The Crisis
Students today aren't just failing classes; they are burning out. 
- **The Problem:** Existing tools manage *tasks*, but they ignore the *human*. A todo list with 50 items doesn't help—it paralyzes.
- **The Solution:** **Rebound** is an AI-powered recovery engine that balances **Academic Workload** with **Mental Health**. It doesn't just tell you *what* to do; it tells you *when* to stop.
