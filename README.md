## The Problem
Students today face a dual crisis: **Overwhelming Academics** and **Mental Health Burnout**. Existing tools manage lists, but they ignore the human element. Students drown in "Todo" lists without knowing *how* or *when* to start.

## The Solution
**Rebound** is not just a task manager. It is an **AI-powered recovery engine** that balances your workload with your mental state. It doesn't just tell you *what* to do; it prioritizes tasks based on your stress level and deadlines.
